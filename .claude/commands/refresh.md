Clear conversation and restore context.

## Do This
1. Run: `/clear`
2. Read @docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md
3. Run: `git status && git branch --show-current`
4. Run: `lsof -ti:3333,4321 || echo "No servers"`

## Rules That Get Lost
- Read files before editing (never from memory)
- No .md files unless asked
- No emojis unless asked
- Simple > clever, working > perfect
- Kill servers before starting new ones
- Feature branches from staging, never main
- Squash merge to staging/main, regular merge for sync
